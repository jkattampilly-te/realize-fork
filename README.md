# realize

The hello-express initial template was used for creating this project. https://github.com/glitchdotcom/hello-express
The current views/index.html contains a basic 360 demo from https://aframe.io/docs/1.0.0/guides/building-a-360-image-gallery.html


## Your Project

On the front-end,

- Edit `views/index.html` to change the content of the webpage
- `public/client.js` is the javacript that runs when you load the webpage
- `public/style.css` is the styles for `views/index.html`

On the back-end,

- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
